And then even on top of that I still may have to pay for  -- \u0080\u0093 for the school.  And then having a part time job although is not always the easiest choice at school, it is good because it teaches you the time management.

For the first reason, smoking is obviously bad for the environment as it produces, um, hazardous gas or I am sorry, chemicals; and for the second reason, second-hand smoking is hazardous to other people's health.
