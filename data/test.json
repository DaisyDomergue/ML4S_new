Uhm, when you have a nonsmoking and smoking sections, it doesn't really do anything because of the way the density of smoke works.

If you have debt, you can spend the rest of your life essentially paying off your debt and being concerned about it while interest piled up.

    "words": "I agree with this statement how smoking should be banned.  It is because, well, first of all, uhm, I'm not a smoker and I'm completely against, uh, smoking since it's not healthy.  It's not healthy for just the smokers, uh, but also for the people around them like their family as well because they turn out to be a second-hand smoker.  And, nowadays, uh, even in the news, they talk about the PM2.5 where the particles of the smoke, uh, it's really, really small.  It could get into your lung.
