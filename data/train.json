Uhm, another good thing about having exper \u2013 or doing a part time or like during college is that it makes you or it gives you more contacts in the field of your choice.

So perhaps in a situation like that it would be better for them not to have a part-time job but just concentrate on their studies and the things that they excel in naturally.

Uhm, I'm also dissatisfied with the way that smoking sections are often organized in restaurants and even if you're sitting in a nonsmoking section, smoke, of course, travels across the room and can quite easily start to, uhm, affect nonsmokers and I often come out of coffee shops in particular smelling like I have also been smoking even though I don't."

They have lot to do, lot of studies, a lot of work and they can learn to make a schedule and to live by that schedule.  It helps to develop good character, it helps to develop good work ethic, it helps to have a student who is not lazy and who provides for their needs and for their family and that is very important as they begin to, uh, live life.  Just studying is not the most important thing but learning to live life meaningful and to be able to, uh, uh, be dependent, uh, have people be able to be dependent upon you, it builds good character.

So you're going to need money for that because obviously get it for free.  But then when \u2013 uh, again it kind of takes away from your studies because you can't study and work at the same time and it gets really important to do well at university because you're spending a lot of money there and getting in debt but then you need to have a job at the same to be able to have sustained life.  So, I think most students do need part time jobs unless they are lucky enough to be able to have their parents to pay for the student fees outright and then they can spend all their time studying which would be much better because then you get much higher grades and then a better job at the end of it, which is what I want to do.  But unfortunately, my parents can't afford that so I am going to have to do a part time job and continue working while I study and making sure that it doesn't take away too much for my grades because that's the most important thing; otherwise, I can't go to Japan and study.

So for  -- \u0080\u0093 for some students, yes, a part-time job would be a very good thing, for many students in fact.

This is the first reason why it's very important for college students to have a part-time job.  The second reason is that having a part-time job help students learn the value of money.

This is important for when the student graduates and starts a job, it may be important for job interviews.  it's also important for tests like the TOEIC which assumes a certain real-world knowledge of business, so even as a student having a part-time job could be useful.  On the other hand \u2013 oh and by the way, a student also needs money, right, to enjoy themselves because all work and no play makes Jack a dull boy.

There is no time in that equation for you to have a part time job as well.
